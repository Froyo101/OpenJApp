This project represents an effort to create a scaling (algorithmically driven according to user input and stats) flashcard utility similar to but distinct from Anki for learning and testing oneself on Japanese Kanji characters, as well as eventually vocabulary and grammar.

In its current state, 2300 Kanji are included, reflecting those presented in Andrew Scott Conning's Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course, and character cards contain both the KKLC's bolded keywords for remembering them by as well as both On and Kun readings where applicable. The app is built in ReactJS with JSX, and to use it currently you'll need to clone the repo, install the appropriate package dependencies via NPM, and then either test or build it via NPM (commands as established by NPM and Create React App are detailed below). Plans are currently in place to host it at my personal domain, https://jakefoiles.xyz, but I intend to complete all basic functionality (primarily user stats storage at this point) before publishing a build there. Bug fixes and other contributions are welcome, and all code (excluding libraries used/referenced as applicable) is licensed under the GPL v3, making it a copyleft piece of Free and Open Source Software.

To fellow language learners - がんばって!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
